Thus, a systematic review was undertaken to identify, describe, and analyze the contributions of biomimicry to design. For this purpose, the integrative systematic review model, called the Theory of Consolidated Meta-Analytical Approach, was used, carrying out a search on the Web of Science with the descriptors \u201cdesign\u201d and \u201cbiomimicry\u201d. For the period from 1991 to 2021, 196 publications were retrieved. The results were organized according to areas of knowledge, countries, journals, institutions, authors, and years. Citation, co-citation, and bibliographic coupling analyses were also performed. The investigation highlighted the following research emphases: the conception of products, buildings, and environments; the exploration of natural structures and systems to create materials and technologies; the use of biomimetic creative tools in product design; and projects focused on saving resources and implementing sustainability. It was noted that there was a tendency for authors to adopt a problem-based approach. It was concluded that the study of biomimicry can stimulate the development of multiple skills in design, improving creativity, and enhancing the potential integration of sustainability into production cycles.\n\nKeywords: design; biomimicry; biomimetic design; systematic review; bio-inspiration; bionics; bio-inspired design; nature-inspired design; bio-informed design; sustainability Citation: S\u00e1, A.A.M.d.; Viana, D.M.\n\nDesign and Biomimicry: A Review of\n\nInterconnections and Creative\n\n1.

On the other hand, there is a focus on the design of components, coatings, and finishes for application in architecture, including bioclimatic factors (e.g., local context, energy, and resource savings) and environmental responsiveness. This enables envisaging the creation of adaptable buildings that operate similarly to living organisms. In this scope, the authors mainly investigated plant elements as a source of inspiration. Among the highlighted works, there were also many proposals for creative tools, frameworks, and parametric software that aim to assist in the search for biological solutions and the transfer of such natural characteristics to the conceptual development in design. Another research emphasis focused on sustainability, including aspects of ecosystems and interspecific ecological relationships that demonstrate the potential to inspire a multiplicity of projects, such as the design of products and even strategic design. In addition, in the present study, there were research perspectives that addressed, respectively, the importance of supporting ecosystem services in the urban environment and the development of materials such as biocomposites.\n\nGiven what is presented above, it is possible to infer that the coupling analysis highlighted initiatives in biomimetic design that demonstrate a remarkable capacity to generate innovations to solve emerging challenges in several fields of human activity. Finally, it should be stressed that, once again, the authors highlighted in the densest cluster produced research and projects guided by the problem-based approach.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThe results of this systematic review allowed establishing connections and making conjectures about the scenarios of publications indexed by the Web of Science. It is be-lieved that the panorama of productions showcased in the present research encompasses contributions that may assist researchers and designers in their endeavors, as the main themes and emphases of projects and research were identified in the investigated literature, representing possible paths for new creations and studies.\n\nThe analysis of the data obtained through this survey indicated that the works involving design and biomimicry are associated with the following thematic aspects: (a) the conception of products, buildings, and environments; (b) the exploration of structural and\n\nBiomimetics 2023, 8, 61\n\n12 of 16\n\nsystemic conform\n######################\nOutput:'}], 'model': 'arcee-ai/Arcee-Spark-GGUF/Arcee-Spark-Q4_K_M.gguf', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1024, 'n': None, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'temperature': 0.5, 'top_p': 1.0}}

In this sense, it is pertinent to mention that the publications, which were listed and organized in this review, reflect development in several areas of cutting-edge technology, which is consistent with the innovative tendency intrinsic to the field of biomimicry.\n\nHowever, it is relevant to underscore that there is still a scarcity of works oriented toward the development and use of everyday objects and in the field of services, given that these are two areas of great importance in the design domain. In view of this finding, it is reasonable to assume that more efforts and investments are required in design projects that clearly and consistently recognize their foundation in the principles of biomimicry.\n\nThus, it is crucial to more frequently adopt a biomimicry perspective to research and develop products intended for the daily lives of consumers, in order to guarantee a better quality of life for the users of these objects (e.g., bio-inspired functional and technological improvements of products). This limitation is even more alarming upon verifying that most of the publications retrieved from the Web of Science originate from engineering and architecture schools and departments. As a result, there are not enough projects produced by teams from schools and departments associated exclusively with the field of design. It is possible to assume that the absence of the ‘design’ filter when searching the Web of Science may constitute a restriction for specific dissemination of works.\n\nAnother trend observed in the present review, highlighted by the analysis of the heat maps, concerns which type of biomimicry-based approach the authors adopted in their projects and research.

The results indicated that many of them started by addressing the problem and the required function (problem-based approach) instead of beginning directly from the investigation of natural aspects (solution-driven approach). It should be clarified that this could be expected since the survey encompassed the field of design, an area where projects and creative processes commonly begin with the definition of a problem or a challenge associated with human activity. However, supporting the development of more projects and research in design based on the solution-driven approach can also be of great interest, as it can contribute to enhancing and refining creative skills. In addition, this approach contributes to establishing connections with specialists from other areas (e.g., biologists) and may also help bring designers closer to field research in nature.\n\nRegarding design processes, efforts were made to provide information about biomimetic tools that assist in the planning and execution of creative proposals (e.g., Biomimicry Thinking Design Lens, Biomimicry Taxonomy Chart, BioTRIZ, GEMS of SAPPhIRE, IDEA-INSPIRE, BECE-Framework) [9,15, 30,35,37,38]. Such instruments, connected to the problem-based approach, mainly focus on the conceptual development phase of the project, supporting the investigation of characteristics of nature in their transposition into the design domain. In addition, various digital resources were explored by the authors to generate complex shapes and patterns for models and products (e.g., parametric software and rapid prototyping). The use of biomimetic tools in creative design processes, reported in the analyzed literature, can still be considered restricted, given that there was not enough detail on the application of such instruments. Consequently, it was not possible to verify, in this review, whether the authors resorted to other resources or documents, or if they deliberately chose not to include this information in the communication of their works.\n\nThe TEMAC model contributed to the identification of the main themes, approaches, and trends in the literature. Through it, it was possible to infer which areas are expanding and which deserve to be further investigated. The tool also allowed comparisons to be made between the works and production of different authors, countries, and institutions.\n\nBiomimetics 2023, 8,\n######################\nOutput:'}], 'model': 'arcee-ai/Arcee-Spark-GGUF/Arcee-Spark-Q4_K_M.gguf', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1024, 'n': None, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'temperature': 0.5, 'top_p': 1.0}}

Through it, it was possible to infer which areas are expanding and which deserve to be further investigated. The tool also allowed comparisons to be made between the works and production of different authors, countries, and institutions.\n\nBiomimetics 2023, 8, 61\n\n13 of 16\n\nIn addition, the recommendation of TEMAC to adopt software, such as VOSViewer and TagCrowd, enabled the graphical representation of the results (e.g., heat maps and line maps), which facilitated carrying out the analyses, in addition to illustrating them satis-factorily. However, like any procedure for surveying and analyzing the literature, it is crucial to understand that, from the moment specifications are established for the research themes, descriptors, software, databases, and filters that will be used, it is inevitable that certain works will not be captured by the selected criteria, which can limit the scope of the contributions of a review such as the present work.\n\nThe chosen database for this research (Web of Science) is one of the main multidisci-plinary repositories, having an excellent temporal coverage of publications, in addition to ensuring a frequent update of indexed works, including complementary materials such as conference proceedings [19]. Nevertheless, the Web of Science mainly covers content published in English and, as discussed earlier, there is no specific filtering function for the field of design. Thus, the investigation of other multilingual repositories, such as Scopus, Google Scholar, EBSCO, ProQuest [19, 47] is recommended. Furthermore, when analyzing other systematic reviews, it is noticeable that other software and platforms, in addition to those employed in the present review, have been used by authors to organize and facilitate data processing. Some examples are: MAXQDA, CiteSpace, Publish or Perish, San-keyMATIc, Bibexcel, Gephi, Pajek, Ucinet, and Science of Science (Sci2) [47–49].\n\nThe adoption of the descriptors biomimicry and design was sufficient to achieve the objectives proposed in the scope of this research. However, considering that only two descriptors were used, it is suggested that more terms be incorporated in future surveys, such as: bioinspiration, biomimetics, bionics, biodesign, biomimetic design, bioinspired design, bionic design, nature-based design, nature-inspired design, biologically-inspired design, and bio-informed design. Thus, it will be possible\n######################\nOutput:'}], 'model': 'arcee-ai/Arcee-Spark-GGUF/Arcee-Spark-Q4_K_M.gguf', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1024, 'n': None, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'temperature': 0.5, 'top_p': 1.0}}

Thus, it will be possible to cover an even greater number of works, which may lead to relevant developments for the scientific and professional communities.\n\nIn summary, with this review, it is necessary to emphasize the importance of adopting interdisciplinary knowledge in the field of design to expand the creative perspectives of professionals and to diversify theories, approaches, and resources. In this sense, biomimicry has shown itself to be an area of great potential for projects in design. In this work, the expression “biomimetic design” was generically adopted when analyzing publications from the intersection between the design and biomimicry domains. However, it is necessary to understand that further efforts are needed in favor of more ‘genuinely’ biomimetic designs, developed in the specific field of design, in which, throughout the entire creative process of products and services, the concepts, principles, and creative tools of biomimicry are effectively integrated.\n\nUnlike technologies that require specific procedures, authorizations, investments, and monetization for access, nature is an extensive (and more accessible) repository of resources that can be investigated and interpreted by human beings, which can complement and expand current practices in design. Furthermore, as evidenced by several authors, the field of design is plural and interdisciplinary, as it seeks to enable creations for different areas of human endeavor [1–4, 50–55]. Including the perspective of biomimicry in teaching and professional practice scenarios in design can expand creative horizons, allowing the creation of innovative solutions that are more efficient, economical, and better adapted to consumer needs and environmental diversity [6, 55,56].\n\nFinally, as the study of aspects of biomimicry in design can enhance the development of multiple skills (such as creative and conceptual generation, observation and research, study of materials, graphic expression, and three-dimensional conception and digital modeling), it is important to recognize that understanding nature and knowing how to explore its resources are indispensable requirements for contemporary professional training, since they can encourage creativity as well as the integration of ecological and sustainable factors in production cycles.\n\nBiomimetics 2023, 8, 61\n\n14 of 16\n\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.A.M.d.S.; methodology,\n######################\nOutput:'}], 'model': 'arcee-ai/Arcee-Spark-GGUF/Arcee-Spark-Q4_K_M.gguf', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1024, 'n': None, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'temperature': 0.5, 'top_p': 1.0}}
